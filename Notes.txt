# Notes

# PHP and MySQL

* To connect to a MySQL database we'll use a PDO object
* The PDO object will need a DSN
	* Data Source Name -> driver, host, database name
* I will also need the username and the password
*
* Database credentials should be ALWAYS excluded frmo git
	* That's the reason why we have a constants.php file


## Similarities

Tables / Result Set -> Arrays -> bi-dimensional
Columns				-> keys in an associative array
Rows				-> item in an array
